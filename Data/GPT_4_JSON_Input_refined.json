        "Definition": "Visuospatial difficulties in a clinical setting refer to problems with identifying visual information and understanding spatial relationships between objects. This can result in challenges with tasks such as drawing, reading maps, judging distances, or recognizing objects or faces. These difficulties are commonly seen in conditions like stroke, brain injuries, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Visuospatial difficulties can significantly impact daily tasks like driving or navigating and may require rehabilitation or other supportive therapies to help accommodate these challenges.",
        "Possible Responses": "Yes, No, Uncertain",
        "Response Guide": "Yes: The clinical note explicitly mentions that the patient has the clinical feature.\nNo: The clinical note does not explicitly mention that the patient has the clinical feature and there is also no information that might suggest the patient has the clinical feature.\nUncertain: The clinical note contains some information that might suggest the patient has the clinical feature (through correlations), but it is not explicitly stated.",
        "Additional Response": "If the response is 'Yes' or 'Uncertain', provide sentences from the clinical note that support your answer. If the response is 'No', then do not provide any other sentences."

        "Feature Name": "Psychomotor disturbance",
        "Concept Question": "Can the following sentence be inferred from the clinical note?: 'The patient exhibits psychomotor disturbance.'",
        "Definition": "Psychomotor disturbance in a clinical setting refers to disruption in a person's ability to process and physically respond to stimuli in their environment. This can present in a multitude of ways, such as psychomotor agitation (characterized by repetitive, often non-goal-directed movement due to mental tension) or psychomotor retardation (characterized by slowed physical and cognitive actions). Such disturbances are commonly seen in conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or under the influence of certain drugs. These disturbances can affect a person's ability to function normally and may require therapeutic interventions targeted at the underlying cause.",

        "Feature Name": "Poor performance on neuropsychological tests of frontal function",
        "Concept Question": "Can the following sentence be inferred from the clinical note?: 'The patient exhibits poor performance on neuropsychological tests of frontal function.'",
        "Definition": "Poor performance on neuropsychological tests of frontal function in a clinical setting refers to difficulties or deficiencies in tasks designed to assess the functioning of the frontal lobes of the brain. These tests often measure abilities such as problem-solving, decision-making, attention and concentration, task flexibility, and social behavior. Poor performance can suggest the presence of a frontal lobe disorder or damage, seen in conditions like traumatic brain injury, stroke, dementia or neurodegenerative disorders. Such impairments can result in significant changes in personality, behavior, and cognitive abilities, often necessitating a full neurological evaluation.",

        "Response Guide": "Yes: The clinical note explicitly mentions that the patient has the clinical feature.\nNo: The clinical note does not explicitly mention that the patient has the clinical feature and there is also no information that might suggest the patient has the clinical feature.\nUncertain: The clinical note contains some information that might suggest the patient has the clinical feature (through correlations), but it is not explicitly stated.",

        "Concept Question": "Can the following sentence be inferred from the clinical note?: 'The patient exhibits ophthaloplegia.'",
        "Definition": "Ophthalmoplegia in a clinical setting refers to the paralysis or weakness in one or more of the muscles that control eye movement. This condition can affect one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral). It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, brain injury, neuromuscular diseases, thyroid dysfunction, or certain infections. Symptoms usually include double vision and/or difficulty moving the affected eye in various directions. Treatment typically targets the underlying cause and, in some cases, prism glasses or eye exercises may help improve vision.",

        "Concept Question": "Can the following sentence be inferred from the clinical note?: 'The patient exhibits wasting particularly affecting the bulbar musculature.'",
        "Definition": "Wasting particularly affecting the bulbar musculature in a clinical setting refers to the significant loss of muscle mass and strength in the muscles controlled by the bulbar region of the brainstem. These muscles are responsible for functions like swallowing, speaking, and chewing. Wasting of these muscles may result in issues with these functions - a condition known as bulbar palsy - and is often seen in neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), certain types of muscular dystrophy, or following a stroke. Treatment generally focuses on symptom management and may include speech therapy, diet modifications, or in severe cases, feeding interventions.",

        "Concept Question": "Can the following sentence be inferred from the clinical note?: 'The patient exhibits normal repetition of words and phrases.'",
        "Definition": "Normal repetition of words and phrases in a clinical setting refers to the ability to accurately repeat spoken language, a basic aspect of speech production. This task is often used in neuropsychological assessments to measure aspects of language function, and involves areas of the brain related to listening, language comprehension, and speech production. Normal function suggests intact neural pathways between these areas. Difficulty or inability to properly repeat words and phrases, even with intact comprehension and speech production, may suggest certain types of language disorders or brain injuries.",

        "Concept Question": "Can the following sentence be inferred from the clinical note?: 'The patient exhibits inability to appropriately shift attention to new stimuli.'",
        "Definition": "Inability to appropriately shift attention to new stimuli in a clinical setting refers to difficulty in redirecting focus from one task or item to another. This may lead to getting easily distracted, or, conversely, having trouble disengaging from one task to focus on something new. It is often seen in conditions that affect executive functions like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), certain types of dementia, or after a stroke affecting the frontal lobes. This can impact a person's ability to perform tasks efficiently and might necessitate cognitive training strategies, medications, or behavioral interventions as treatment.",
