Delirium
This clinical syndrome is caused either by a diffuse brain pathology (for example, intracranial infections, head trauma, epilepsy (postictal states and non-convulsive status), raised intracranial pressure, subarachnoid haemorrhage) or is secondary to a large number of systemic illnesses or insults, including infections, metabolic derangements, hypoxia, and drugs. The clinical features include the acute onset of attentional abnormalities and disturbance of consciousness (from clouding to coma), perceptual distortions, illusions and hallucinations, psychomotor disturbance (hypo- or hyperactivity and rapid shifts between the two), disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle, emotional lability, and marked fluctuations in performance and behaviour. The most consistent abnormality is in attention, with a reduced ability to maintain attention to external stimuli leading to distractibility and difficulty answering questions, and to appropriately shift attention to new stimuli leading to perseverations. The investigation and treatment needs to be focused in each case on the likely precipitants (although in about 5–20 per cent of the elderly no cause is found). Although the course and prognosis depend on the underlying diagnosis, if there is resolution of the precipitant there should be cognitive improvement to the baseline state.
